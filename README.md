# University of London Team Scheduler Project
## CM2020 Agile Software Projects - April 2022 Session


### About The Project
<hr>

This project is a full stack desktop web application that allows a team to coordinate events together on a coordinated shared calendar. In particular, the application was designed to be able to accomodate a remotely distributed team across largely differing timezones. 

The application uses the following technologies,
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> as the React framework. In particular, the <a href="https://fullcalendar.io/">FullCalendar.io</a> library is leveraged to handle standard calendar UI/UX features.</li>
<li><a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction">Next.js API routes</a> for server-side API routes as the backend</li>
<li><a href="https://prisma.io/">Prisma</a> as the ORM for migrations and database access</li>
<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> as the database.</li>
<li><a href="https://next-auth.js.org/">NextAuth.js</a> for authentication via GitHub (OAuth)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> as the main programming language</li>
<li><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> for deployment</li>
</ul>

This project was created for educational purposes only.
